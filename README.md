# Cancer Awareness and Screening Among Females
## Background
This repo includes the R code I build to visualize the Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS)- HINTS 5, Cycle 4 (2020). My intent was to understand to what extent women are aware of cancer and cancer screening. This project was part of my Data visualization class at Tufts University. 
## Procedures
I used R-Sutdio to write the code and relaied mainly on the ggplot2 package.<br>  
First, I created a subset of variables that only included females (18 years and older).<br>
Second, I changed some variables to factors.<br>
Third, build a table that summarizes the descriptive statistics about the sample.<br> 
Forth, build visualizations for the following topics.<br>
  1. Break down fo the sample by region and commuting area
  2. Awareness of the HPV vaccine
  3. Awareness of HPV cause cervical, anal, penile, and oral cancer.
  4. Most recent pap-test against age and income.
  5. Most recent pap-test against age and income.
  6. Have ever Done Colon Cancer testing Against Age and Income.
  7. Talked to a professional About Lung Cancer Screening in the Past Year.<br>
  
Fifth, built a contingency table for current and former smokers and those who asked for lung cancer testing.<br>
Lastly, I provided recommendations. <br>  
 ## Recommendations
1. Increase awareness of the HPV vaccine among young females
2. Look into the rate of HPV vaccination 
3. Increase awareness about what HPV could cause (besides cervical cancer)
4. Encourage females to follow the recommendations for the pap test
5. Encourage females who are 40 years and older to perform an annual mammogram
6. Encourage females who are 45 years and older to perform a regular colon cancer screening 
7. Encourage current and former smoker females who are 50-80 years old to perform a lung cancer screening
